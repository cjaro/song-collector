To adddifficulty, split the group into three parts by assigning each a number. Students stand in arandom formation throughout an open space. Students should NOT be standing in theirgroups; they should be in mixed formation. First, sing the song in unison, again workingtoward singing in two and then three parts. (Mock-Garner)Poly Dot GameTen or twelve colored poly dots are placed on the floor. The students walk among (not on) thedots while the teacher sings core patterns containing low ti. One pattern is designated the magicpattern. When the pattern is sung, the students must get to a poly dot. Those without a dotcontinue to walk in the next repetition  (singing music alone shall live) while the others stand on their dot and sing (the pattern from before). When the magic pattern is sung again, those on a dot must get to another dot while those not on a dot musttry to steal one. The patterns can be sung on solfa or on a neutral syllable to add difficulty.Once the students are comfortable working with one pattern, assign two magic patterns and addsquare dots to the floor. One pattern is assigned to the round dots and the other the square dots.Play the same game above, singing either on solfa or a neutral syllable. (Mock-Garner)	l,-t,-d	4.4.4.	a.b.a.	a.b.a.

In the town of Springhill, Nova Scotia,Late in the year of fifty-eight;Day still comes and the sun still shines,But it’s dark as the grave in the Cumberland mine,Dar as the grave in the Cumberland mine.3.  Down at the coal face, miners working,Battle of the belt and the cutter’s blade,Rumble of the rock and the walls close round,The living and the dead men two miles down,Living and the dead men two miles down.4. Listen for the shouts of the bareface miners,Listen through the rubble for a rescue team,Six hundred feet of coal and slag,Hope imprisoned in a three-foot seam,Hope imprisoned in a three-foot seam.5.  Eight days passed and some were rescued,Leaving the dead to lie alone,Through all their lives they’d dug a grave,Two miles of earth for a marking stone,Two miles of earth for a marking stone.6. Twelve men lay two miles from the pit-shaft,Twelve men lay in the dark and sang;Long hot days in the miner’s tomb,It was three feet high and a hundred long,It was three feet high and a hundred long.7.  Three days passed and the lamps gave out,Caleb Rushton, he up and said:“There’s no more water, nor light, nor bread,So we’ll live on songs and hope instead,So we’ll live on songs and hope instead.8.  In the town of Springhill, you don’t sleep easy,Often the earth will tremble and toll,When the earth is restless, miners die,Bone and blood is the price of coal,Bone and blood is the price of coal.	\N	\N	d’-t-l (dorian feel) r-d-r	2.2.2.2.2.	a.b.c.av.av	a.b.c.d.e.

The child to whom the key was given then leads the singing of stanza 3 (all students sing with tme).  They then become the new “it” and sing stanza 1, begin the process again.Alternative: Two “it”s.  First “it” goes outside of room to wait while second “it” hides the key in the classroom.  First “it” returns to classroom and sings stanza 2 to class, proceeds to wander room in search of key.  Class sings stanza 1 as in “hot and cold”- singing with a forte as “it” walks closer to key, and singing in a piano as “it” is farther away from key.  Once found, first “it” sings stanza 3.

The teacher tells a story about an elf named piano who trips on his way to his giant friends house (forte).  He pleads with the cobbler to mend the shoe (rhyme) in a small voice, yet the cobbler can’t hear piano, so won’t fix the shoe.  The story is repeated, but forte tripping and saying the rhyme to the cobbler. The rhyme can be an aid in introducing dynamics, with the children repeating it in both piano and forte dynamic levels.	\N	2.2.2.2.	\N	a.a.a.a.

The man would chose a partner from the ring and the dancers would skip around them singing 'Two in the middle and I can't dance Josie.' This would continue until all couples were In the center.

Get Along, Little Dogies was included by the distinguished American composer, Aaron Copland, in his ballet suite Billie the Kid (1938).” (2—3)	Heritage songster: 320 folk and familiar songs, Leon & Lynn Dallin, 1978, 2.	\N	Get along little dogies.docx	2	132

Whoever T points to at the end of that is an apple and moves to the center.  Teacher then says, “We have 1 apple in our pie, and we want 6 (or however many the class has decided on).  how many more do we need?”  Then the rhyme and game start again and the process continues until the decided-upon number of apples have gone into the pie.

They first “dance” asthe text indicates, but in subsequent repetitions, students can suggest different ways to move(jump, skip, twirl, etc.). Once the students are comfortable with the movement, the teacherthen instructs them to sing again, stopping when they sing high do the first time it occurs in thesong, and then not moving until they sing high do the second time it occurs in the song.Over the RainbowCore high do patterns from known songs are written in staff notation on a piece of cardstock(see electronic visual for template). Students can work individually or in small groups.Students are handed a card as well as an envelope containing color strips. The class decodesand sings each pattern. Next, the teacher sings each pattern on solfa syllables after assigningthat pattern a color. The students must then locate the melodic pattern and place the color stripover their chosen pattern. If they do this correctly, all groups should have placed their colorstrips creating a rainbow of colors at the culmination of the activity. To add difficulty, theteacher could follow the same process stated above, but sing the patterns on a neutral syllable.	d-d'-s, m-d'-s	2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.	A.Av.B.Bv.	A.A.B.B.

A farmer stands in the center of the circle, anda goose stands on the outside of the circle. Students sing song; on the final beat, those inthe circle let go of their hands and clap their own hands above their heads (could clap to 15, 20, etc…), creating opengates for the chase between the farmer and goose. The farmer tries to chase and tag thegoose. If the goose is tagged, a new goose is chosen for the next round, and the farmerremains as the chaser. If the goose is not tagged, a new farmer is chosen, but the gooseremains in the game for the next round.Solfa Fun!Working in pairs, students are handed a laminated card containing solfa syllables. Theactivity begins with the teacher singing core melodic motives containing the newelement. Some suggested patterns are provided below. The students echo the patternswhile tapping the solfa syllables. Next, the teacher sings patterns again on solfa. Thestudents echo and mark the last syllable sung with a symbol such as a star, dot, orsquare. In late practice and assessment, the solfa syllables are taken out and the teachersings the patterns on a neutral syllable; the students are then required to decode thepattern and identify the last sound. When finished with four or five patterns, the teachercan quickly scan the cards to check answers.(Mock-Garner)	\N	2.2.2.2.	\N	a.a.b.a.

Asking leaders to stay at the head of the line.  The leaders create movements which the players next to them imitate a measure later.  As the next player executes the previous movement of the player ahead of him, he has to concentrate at the same time on the new movement being created by the player ahead of him for him to execute with continuity.

Thestudents can sing the song, substituting “red” with another color of choice. In addition,instead of singing “love,” students can substitute other terms of endearment.Valentine RacesStudents read and decode core re patterns illustrated on the board. Students break intofour or five teams. Each team lines up opposite cards placed on the floor (cards containthe same patterns as those on board). One student from each team takes a turn. Theteacher sings a pattern, the students echo back. The students then race across the room,selecting the pattern from their pile. The first to return to the starting line with thecorrect pattern receives two points for his/her team. If the rest of the students also collectthe correct pattern, they earn a point for their team. The teams keep track of points byplacing valentine candies or foamies in a team mailbox. The team with the most pointsat the end of the game wins.	d-r-m. d-r-d	2.2.2.2.	a.b.a.c.	a.b.a.b.

Use patting to determine that the notes that match the word “stretch” receive two beats.  Label the note as half not and present its card.  Use the rhythmic building block cards to notate the rhythm of the song.  Students each find a partner and receive a small stack or rhythm cards.  each partner constructs a 4-beat rhythm using two cards.  Don’t forget that sometimes two of the same card may be used!  Partners should combine their two 4-beat patterns to form an 8-beat pattern.Students should decide if their pattern sounds finished at the end.  If so, there should be no eighth notes on the final beat.  Adjust the pattern until a well-punctuated ending is created.  Partners practice their 8-beat pattern by speaking and clapping.  Students sing the song again. Between each performance of the song, each pair of partners will perform their 8-beat rhythm. After each group has performed once, try a version of the game where you ask a few individual students to improvise a 4-beat rhythm on their instrument.  After each performance of the song, two students will improvise- one after the other.  Change the words to identify the first and second student to improvise i.e. “Katie’s tapping at the window. Jared’s knocking at the door.”  After the song, Katie improvises 4 beats and is followed by Jared improvising 4 beats.  	s-r-m/m-r-d	4.4.4.4.	a.av.a.av.	a.b.a.b.

To add difficulty, split the group into three parts by assigning each a number. Students stand in a random formation throughout an open space. Students should NOT be standing in their groups; they should be in mixed formation. First, sing the song in unison, again working toward singing in two and then three parts. (Mock-Garner)  Poly Dot Game Ten or twelve colored poly dots are placed on the floor. The students walk among (not on) the dots while the teacher sings core patterns containing low ti. One pattern is designated the magic pattern. When the pattern is sung, the students must get to a poly dot. Those without a dot continue to walk in the next repetition (singing music alone shall live) while the others stand on their dot and sing (the pattern from before). When the magic pattern is sung again, those on a dot must get to another dot while those not on a dot must try to steal one. The patterns can be sung on solfa or on a neutral syllable to add difficulty. Once the students are comfortable working with one pattern, assign two magic patterns and add square dots to the floor. One pattern is assigned to the round dots and the other the square dots. Play the same game above, singing either on solfa or a neutral syllable.

Players continue around the circle repeating the same motion, being sure to place their hand back in the starting position. At the counting at the end of the song the fun begins. If the last player gets tapped they are "out".  However the last player may think quickly and pull their hand away, not getting tapped and the next to last player would be "out." "Out" could mean that those players start a new circle and continue playing the game.	s,-l,-t,-d	4.4.4.4.	a.ai.b.c	a.a.b.c	14	34	\N	6	D-F	\N	Eisen, Ann and Lamar Robertson. An American Methodology.

It serves well as a vehicle for his instnnnental ability, with the words playing a secondary role. I have been unable to find similar texts in print. The nature of the stanzas which Mr. Steele sings suggests that his text may be fragmentary. He does not remember from whom he learned this song. "Gain' Around this World, Baby Mine" Goin' around this world, baby mine, Gain' around this world, baby mine, Gain' around this world With a banjo pickin' girl, Goin' around this world, baby mine.

In the town of Springhill, Nova Scotia, Late in the year of fifty-eight; Day still comes and the sun still shines, But it's dark as the grave in the Cumberland mine, Dar as the grave in the Cumberland mine.  3. Down at the coal face, miners working, Battle of the belt and the cutter's blade, Rumble of the rock and the walls close round, The living and the dead men two miles down, Living and the dead men two miles down.  4. Listen for the shouts of the bareface miners, Listen through the rubble for a rescue team, Six hundred feet of coal and slag, Hope imprisoned in a three-foot seam, Hope imprisoned in a three-foot seam.  5. Eight days passed and some were rescued, Leaving the dead to lie alone, Through all their lives they'd dug a grave, Two miles of earth for a marking stone, Two miles of earth for a marking stone.  6. Twelve men lay two miles from the pit-shaft, Twelve men lay in the dark and sang; Long hot days in the miner's tomb, It was three feet high and a hundred long, It was three feet high and a hundred long.  7. Three days passed and the lamps gave out, Caleb Rushton, he up and said: "There's no more water, nor light, nor bread, So we'll live on songs and hope instead, So we'll live on songs and hope instead.  8. In the town of Springhill, you don't sleep easy, Often the earth will tremble and toll, When the earth is restless, miners die, Bone and blood is the price of coal, Bone and blood is the price of coal.	\N	\N	d'-t-l (dorian feel) r-d-r	2.2.2.2.2.	a.b.c.av.av	a.b.c.d.e.	18	4	Nova Scotia/ Scottish	17	C-E	Smithsonian folkways recording:  Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger, released 1960 via Folkway records "New Briton Gazette, Vol. 1" Album, Scottish  http://www.folkways.si.edu/ewan-maccoll-and-peggy-seeger/the-ballad-of-springhill/celtic-historical-song-struggle-protest-world/music/track/smithsonian	Locke, Sail Away. 138.	436	2

Inner circle consists of four students. The other students stand in the outside circle.	Stanza 1: Students step/circle around holding hands. One circle moves in one direction, the other in the opposite direction. Stanza 2: Each student in the inner circle selects a student/partner from the outer circle. Stanza 3: The eight students in the center stand still while the outer circle steps/circles around them. At the end of the stanza, the original four students step into the outer circle, leaving their partners in the center. The four students left in the center form a new inner circle and a new repetition begins.  Melodic Change-Up Create groups of two or three students. Give each group a set of foam cubes or paper cards containing a desired tone set. First, the teacher sings core patterns on solfa syllables (suggested patterns are listed below). The students sing the pattern and arrange cards according to the melodic contour. The teacher then sings the pattern again, changing one pitch. The students mark the changed pitch with a star or circle foamie. To increase difficulty, the teacher follows the same procedure but sings all patterns on a neutral syllable, only providing the students with the starting pitch.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	17	\N	Listed as "Appalachian Mountain song," last verse in particular suggests it might be a dance call.	www.joe-offer.com/folkinfo/songs/758.html.

This not only soothed the doggies, but was a way of communicating their positions to the other riders on watch. Get Along, Little Dogies was included by the distinguished American composer, Aaron Copland, in his ballet suite Billie the Kid (1938)."

Bessie Jones explains that the clapping pattern is done on one side of the body with the triplet clapping phrase as follows: 1. slap side of thigh with palm of hand in upward brush. 2. Continue upward to strike the chest with palm of hand. 3. Strike thigh downward with back of hand. Do this 2 times and then slap thigh three times. This pattern is repeated each time after the rhyme. The rest of the stanzas are similar to "Frog went a'courtin."	Jones, Bessie and Bess Lomax Hawes, Step it Down, 34 €“ 36.	558	2

(best "choose a number between 3-7") While all chant rhyme, T walks around the inside of the circle, pointing to each child or tapping heads, stopping on "lie." That child must say "yes" or "no." If "yes," all chant: "Y-E-S and you are the best- apple in the whole world!" (that last said very fast) OR if "no,": "N-O and in you go!" while the teacher continues around the circle. Whoever T points to at the end of that is an apple and moves to the center. Teacher then says, "We have 1 apple in our pie, and we want 6 (or however many the class has decided on). how many more do we need?" Then the rhyme and game start again and the process continues until the decided-upon number of apples have gone into the pie. They are then sliced, baked and eaten in a very silly way.	\N	2.2.2.2.	\N	\N	15	34	\N	17	\N	\N	Miragliotta, Nikki MSU KodÃ¡ly Institute, 2015	575	2

They first "dance" as the text indicates, but in subsequent repetitions, students can suggest different ways to move (jump, skip, twirl, etc.). Once the students are comfortable with the movement, the teacher then instructs them to sing again, stopping when they sing high do the first time it occurs in the song, and then not moving until they sing high do the second time it occurs in the song.  Over the Rainbow Core high do patterns from known songs are written in staff notation on a piece of cardstock (see electronic visual for template). Students can work individually or in small groups. Students are handed a card as well as an envelope containing color strips. The class decodes and sings each pattern. Next, the teacher sings each pattern on solfa syllables after assigning that pattern a color. The students must then locate the melodic pattern and place the color strip over their chosen pattern. If they do this correctly, all groups should have placed their color strips creating a rainbow of colors at the culmination of the activity. To add difficulty, the teacher could follow the same process stated above, but sing the patterns on a neutral syllable.	d-d'-s, m-d'-s	2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.	A.Av.B.Bv.

Boys and girls take hands, cross hands as in skating position and walk around, counter-clockwise, in a circle while singing the first phrase of the song. When they reach the word "over", partners 'wring the dish rag'- raise their crossed hands while each child turns completely around without dropping their partners' hands. This movement is repeated twice. It can be quickly mastered with a little practice. After the double bar, hands are dropped and the boys make a circle inside the girls' circle. The boys move around in clockwise direction while the girls continue counter-clockwise. At the end of the song, boys choose the girls they are nearest and the dance begins again.	d-l,-s,-d	4.4.4.4.	a.b.c.ai.	a.b.c.d.	15	28	\N	17	F-A	\N	Erdei, Peter and Kodaly Musical Training Institute. 150 American Folk Songs to sing read and play.

Children stand in a circle and hold hands. One child stands in the middle and is the fish. Another child is on the outside and is the fisherman. At the end of the song the circle drops hands and the fisherman tries to catch the fish. Use of a pool noodle as club is recommended.   Game Students form a double circle, one student who is "it" stands in the center. Partners walk side-by-side/promenade counter clockwise while singing the song. On the last beat, all students break from partners to find a new partner and scramble back to a wall (or designated spot in the room). "It" grabs a partner. The person left without a partner becomes the new "it" during the next repetition of the song.	s-l-s	2.2.2.2.	a.b.c.d.	a.b.c.d.	15	2	\N	17	A-C	Go Fish! In pairs, students "go fishing" in the pond while the class sings the song. The students catch cards containg core melodic patterns. When every student has a card, the teacher sings the melodic patterns on solfa syllables and the students hold their card up when it is sung. To make this activity more difficult, the patterns could be sung on a nuetral syllable.  Extension Activity In pairs, students "go fishing" in the pond while the class sings the song. The students catch cards containing core melodic patterns. Some cards are blank. When every student in each group of four has a card, they create melodic etudes and then practice their etude. Following the practice sessions, each group sings their created etude for the class. If a student catches a blank card, they are responsible for improvising a m sl melody as it appears in the created etude. (Mock-Garner)	McIlroy, Heidi from Singing Games Children Love	589	2

The group sings the above song while another student, carrying a small heart bead hidden between his/her hands travels around the circle tapping each student's hands. The student with the bead must secretly drop the heart in the hands of a student in the circle. The guesser must guess who has the heart. If correct, the guesser becomes the passer. If not, the passer remains and a new guesser is chosen from the group.  My Heart is Empty This activity can either be done as a large group or in student dyads. Four-beat rhythm patterns are listed on the board or on individual sheets. Each pattern is written again next to the original pattern, but some beats are left empty. The students tap each full pattern (black box), followed by a student tapping the second pattern (pink box), improvising the missing beats.

Accompany the poem with a simple pat-clap pattern throughout. The first student in the circle says their name in 2 beats, and the class echoes the name in the same style and vocal quality as the leader.   After four students have spoken their name and the class has echoed each, the class speaks all four names (2 beats each) from the most recent to the first, and then the poem repeats. Decide whether to repeat only the four names from a particular turn or to repeat the names all the way back to the very first name of the game as the game continues.	\N	\N	\N	\N	19	9	\N	17	\N	\N	Chandler, Michael.

The teacher may say "windows closed" at any time, which means that the players must put their arms down- sometimes the cat is caught inside the circle or the mother is inside the circle, or both!

A farmer stands in the center of the circle, and a goose stands on the outside of the circle. Students sing song; on the final beat, those in the circle let go of their hands and clap their own hands above their heads (could clap to 15, 20, etc...), creating open gates for the chase between the farmer and goose. The farmer tries to chase and tag the goose. If the goose is tagged, a new goose is chosen for the next round, and the farmer remains as the chaser. If the goose is not tagged, a new farmer is chosen, but the goose remains in the game for the next round.  Solfa Fun! Working in pairs, students are handed a laminated card containing solfa syllables. The activity begins with the teacher singing core melodic motives containing the new element. Some suggested patterns are provided below. The students echo the patterns while tapping the solfa syllables. Next, the teacher sings patterns again on solfa. The students echo and mark the last syllable sung with a symbol such as a star, dot, or square. In late practice and assessment, the solfa syllables are taken out and the teacher sings the patterns on a neutral syllable; the students are then required to decode the pattern and identify the last sound. When finished with four or five patterns, the teacher can quickly scan the cards to check answers.

The movements are executed in a canonic fashion. For older children, the leader can combine different movements in a single measure.  Variation: If there are many players, divide the players into different groups and have the groups form straight lines. Asking leaders to stay at the head of the line. The leaders create movements which the players next to them imitate a measure later. As the next player executes the previous movement of the player ahead of him, he has to concentrate at the same time on the new movement being created by the player ahead of him for him to execute with continuity.  Change tempo to make it more challenging.	\N	1	\N	aaa...	16	9	Manila/ Philippines	16	\N	\N	Factora, Miriam. Musical Folk Games of Manila (Philippines)	734	2

The student then holds the shell up to his/her ear and improvises an answer to "What do you hear?" The whole class echo sings the soloist's answer. The activity repeats.  Melody Beach Ball Students stand in random formation in an open space. Teacher sings Seashell on a neutral syllable while the students toss the ball to each other. When the teacher stops, the student holding the ball checks to see which color his/her right hand is resting on. Whichever color his/her hand is on is the color of the melodic pattern the class will read on the board. The students then decode and sing a familiar pattern from stick or staff notation. The activity continues until all melodic patterns have been sung.	m-r-d, d-r-m	2.2.2.2.1.1.	A.Av.b.b.	a.av.b.b.	15	10	\N	17	\N	\N	Mock-Garner, Leigh Ann.

Using New Moon, New Moon text, the teacher and students take turns singing a vocal improvisation on each eight-beat phrase of the rhyme. The parameters for the improvisation are as follows: 1. Each phrase is sung using the syllables do, re, or mi; and 2. The final phrase ends on do. New Moon, New Moon Star in the stream Tell me my fortune In my dream (traditional; North America)  Extension Activity Students can use the rhythm of the New Moon, New Moon text as a structure for improvising on barred instruments. The parameters listed above for the vocal improvisation can be used for the instrumental work as well. A final form is created, alternating between singing the song (A), students playing the instrumental improvisation (B) and vocally improvising (C). A final form is illustrated below. A. Sing Shoheen Sho with Vocal Ostinato B. Instrumental Improvisation A. Sing Shoheen Sho with Vocal Ostinato C. Vocal Improvisation A.

Players join hands in a single circle, Two couples step into circle to start game.	Couples in center form a right hand star (two men join right hands, two girls join right hands above the men's at right angles. Or the star may be made by each of the four placing his right hand on top of the right write of the player to their left, forming a basket-weave). While everyone sings the first verse, circle moves around in a walking step counterclockwise, and the center couples skip around clockwise. Verse 2: Two center couples change to a left hand star and reverse direction. Larger circle also sings and moves in opposite direction. Verse 3: Each player in the center chooses a new player from the circle and the four new ones form a right hand star and prepare to repeat dance. During this verse, the players in the larger circle stand in place and sign and clap the beat.	s,-l,-t,-d	2.2.2.2.	a.b.a.c.	a.b.a.c.	24	28	\N	17	C-E	Great in January with 4th/5th :)	Locke, Eleanor G.

The students can sing the song, substituting "red" with another color of choice. In addition, instead of singing "love," students can substitute other terms of endearment.  Valentine Races Students read and decode core re patterns illustrated on the board. Students break into four or five teams. Each team lines up opposite cards placed on the floor (cards contain the same patterns as those on board). One student from each team takes a turn. The teacher sings a pattern, the students echo back. The students then race across the room, selecting the pattern from their pile. The first to return to the starting line with the correct pattern receives two points for his/her team. If the rest of the students also collect the correct pattern, they earn a point for their team. The teams keep track of points by placing valentine candies or foamies in a team mailbox. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.	d-r-m. d-r-d	2.2.2.2.	a.b.a.c.	a.b.a.b.	15	23	\N	17	A-D	Mock-Garner, Leigh Ann. Cultivating Creative Musicians, 2015, 39-40.	\N	794	2

The following motion (motion #1) is performed with partner repeatedly: patch-clap-right-clap-left-clap-both-clap. (the pattern one time through takes 8 beats) At any point, the teacher may shout, "gee," signaling students to move to their right (skipping one person and finding new partner, two to the right) or "haw," signaling a move to the left, skipping one person and finding new partner, two people to the left. (an easier step is to have only one circle move) More challenge: learn motions #2 and #3. The teacher can then shout "gee" or "haw", "1" or "2" or "3." The teacher may should signals at regular phrase intervals or completely randomly. Motion #2: each partner holds left palm out, facing up, and places right elbow in partner's left palm. This is beat 1. Clap on beat 2. Reverse palm and elbow (left elbow in partner's right palm) for beat 3. Clap on beat 4. Repeat entire motion to make 8 beats.

(Michael Chandler's extension, Orff level I, 2010 UST, adapted from Julie Scott) Students move to the song's rhythm by making their feet match the rhythms of the three model words from the rhythmic building blocks: walk, jogging, stretch.   Use patting to determine that the notes that match the word "stretch" receive two beats. Label the note as half not and present its card. Use the rhythmic building block cards to notate the rhythm of the song.   Students each find a partner and receive a small stack or rhythm cards. each partner constructs a 4-beat rhythm using two cards. Don't forget that sometimes two of the same card may be used! Partners should combine their two 4-beat patterns to form an 8-beat pattern.  Students should decide if their pattern sounds finished at the end. If so, there should be no eighth notes on the final beat. Adjust the pattern until a well-punctuated ending is created. Partners practice their 8-beat pattern by speaking and clapping.   Students sing the song again. Between each performance of the song, each pair of partners will perform their 8-beat rhythm. After each group has performed once, try a version of the game where you ask a few individual students to improvise a 4-beat rhythm on their instrument. After each performance of the song, two students will improvise- one after the other. Change the words to identify the first and second student to improvise i.e. "Katie's tapping at the window. Jared's knocking at the door." After the song, Katie improvises 4 beats and is followed by Jared improvising 4 beats.	s-r-m/m-r-d	4.4.4.4.	a.av.a.av.	a.b.a.b.	2	10	\N	17	D-F	\N	Erdei, Peter and Kodaly Musical Training Institute. 150 American Folk Songs to sing read and play.
